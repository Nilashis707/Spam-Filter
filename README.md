An ML model to classify sms text messsages as spam or ham

Any text has been first preprocessed to remove the unneccessary stopwords and punctuations. After the preprocessing part, we perform the process of vectorisation of words, and using some natural NLP techniques, similarities between texts are recognised. The model then uses naive bayes classification to classify the message as spam or ham.
